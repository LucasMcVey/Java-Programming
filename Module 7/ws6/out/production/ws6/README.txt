The package "q" is the one that we used in the workshop.
The "quiz" package uses the same idea, but the code structure is a little
more elaborate (which makes the program more flexible). Rather than
adding questions to the Quiz directly, we create a QuestionBank out
of all the questions, and then link the Quiz to the QuestionBank, and
have it select random Questions from the QuestionBank to ask.

The package "objectasparam" is roughly the same as the "oap" package
used in the workshop (same programming ideas, may be minor changes).
